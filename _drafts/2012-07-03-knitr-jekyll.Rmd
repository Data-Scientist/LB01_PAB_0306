The [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) package provides an easy way to embed 
[R](http://www.r-project.org/) code in a [Jekyll-Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/) 
blog post. The only required input is an **R Markdown** source file. 
The name of the source file used to generate this post is *2012-07-03-knitr-jekyll.Rmd*, available
[here](https://github.com/jfisher-usgs/jfisher-usgs.github.com/blob/master/Rmd/2012-07-03-knitr-jekyll.Rmd).
Steps taken to build this post are as follows:

### Step 1

Create a Jekyll-Boostrap blog if you don't already have one. 
A brief tutorial on building this blog is available 
[here](/lessons/2012/05/30/jekyll-build-on-windows/).

### Step 2

Open the R Console and process the source file:
```{r eval=FALSE}
KnitPost <- function(input, base.url = "/") {
  require(knitr)
  opts_knit$set(base.url = base.url)
  fig.path <- paste0("figs/", sub(".Rmd$", "", basename(input)), "/")
  opts_chunk$set(fig.path = fig.path)
  opts_chunk$set(fig.cap = "center")
  render_jekyll()
  knit(input, envir = parent.frame())
}
KnitPost("2012-07-03-knitr-jekyll.Rmd")
```

### Step 3

Move the resulting image folder *2012-07-03-knitr-jekyll* and **Markdown** file 
*2012-07-03-knitr-jekyll.md* to the local 
*jfisher-usgs.github.com* [git](http://git-scm.com/) repository.
The KnitPost function assumes that the image folder will be placed in a 
[figs](https://github.com/jfisher-usgs/jfisher-usgs.github.com/tree/master/figs) 
folder located at the root of the repository.

### Step 4

Add the following CSS code to the 
*/assets/themes/twitter-2.0/css/bootstrap.min.css* file to center images:

    [alt=center] {
      display: block;
      margin: auto;
    }

That's it.

Here are a few examples of embedding R code:
```{r}
summary(cars)
```

```{r fig1, fig.width=6, fig.height=4, echo=TRUE}
par(mar = c(4, 4, 0.1, 0.1), omi = c(0, 0, 0, 0))
plot(cars)
```
##### Figure 1: Caption

```{r fig2, fig.width=8, fig.height=7, echo=TRUE}
par(mar = c(2.5, 2.5, 0.5, 0.1), omi = c(0, 0, 0, 0))
filled.contour(volcano)
```
##### Figure 2: Caption

And don't forget your session information for proper reproducible research.
```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
